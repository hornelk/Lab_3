# Project Name: Walking Tour of Napoleonic Landmarks in Ajaccio, Corsica

## Brief Introduction
This web map was created as my third lab for GHY3412: Web Mapping, taught by Dr. Johnathan Sugg at Appalachian State University. The topic of Napoleonic Landmarks was chosen as I developed a fascination for the character and the era after going to see the _dissapointing_ and incredibly innaccurate Ridley Scott Film, "Napoleon". This inspired me to learn what actually transpired in Europe during the Napoleonic era.
